# Installation
```bash
pip install causeinfer
```

# Application

### Causal inference algorithms:
#### 1. The Two Model Approach
- Separate models for treatment and control groups are trained and combined to derive average treatment effects.

#### 2. Interaction Term Approach - Lo 2002
- An interaction term between treatment and covariates is added to the data to allow for a basic single model application.

#### 3. Response Transformation Approach - Lai 2006; Kane, Lo and Zheng 2014
- Units are categorized into four classes to derive the treatment effected from positive class attributes.

#### 4. Generalized Random Forest - Athey, Tibshirani, and Wager 2019
- An application of an honest causalaity based splitting random forest.

### Evaluation metrics:
#### 1. Qini and AUUC Scores
- Comparisons across stratefied, ordered treatment response groups are used to derive model efficiency

#### 2. GRF Confidence Intervals
- Confidence intervals are created using GRF's standard deviation across trials
