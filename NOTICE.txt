NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the
License.

You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and
conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole,
provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this
License.

5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for
inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any

consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the

and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such
damages.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose
to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights
consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your
sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each
Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your
accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
